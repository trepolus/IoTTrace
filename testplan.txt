TESTPLAN

1. heatmap as a whole

- radius depends on zoom size, the smaller the displayed area, the bigger the radius
- other gmap parameters should be rather fixed, as they don't improve visibility etc.
- time should be varied on certain intervals like 2 or 3 hours, see Lucas' python script, but independant from the day
- zoom size should be varied as well

2. heatmap as a composite of heatmaps of smaller regions
